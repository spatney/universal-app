# Universal App

A lean React + Vite starter that **grows into whatever you ask for**. Instead of
committing you to an app shape up front, it ships a small "hello world" home page
plus a **capability router** the agent reads first — it picks the right Rayfin
services, installs the right npm modules, and activates the right skills for the
app you describe.

> Build your app, then deploy it to a Fabric workspace with `npm run rayfin:up`.
> For a quick look without a backend, run `npm run preview` to serve the home
> page locally (no backend, no sign-in).

## How it works

Describe what you want in plain English. The agent starts at the **capability
router** (`AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/capability-router/`), maps your request
to one or more **capability packs**, and only then pulls each one in:

| You ask for… | The router activates | Which brings in |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in / accounts / per-user data | `authentication` | Wire the Fabric auth that already ships in `src/services/` |
| Data, records, CRUD, a database | `data-modeling` | Entities + row-level security in `rayfin/data/`, `data` service |
| Charts, dashboards, KPIs | `graphein-visuals` | Author Graphein specs, drop into `<Chart>` |
| Power BI / semantic-model analytics | `analytics` | The dashboard kit, DAX queries, and headless preview |

Nothing heavy is loaded until it's needed — the base app stays small and fast.

## Getting started

Describe what you want to build to your coding agent, or start editing. To deploy
to Fabric:

```bash
npm run rayfin:up
```

Authentication ships wired **off** so the app previews with no backend. The
router turns it on when your app needs sign-in — see
`.agents/skills/authentication/SKILL.md`.

## Scripts
